Alright, well, I've spent the last couple of hours trying to get up and running with Jekyll. This is the first blog post I'm writing, just as a test really. 

It's interesting to be writing prose in markdown; of course I've done it for documentation or pull request descriptions before, but for longer passages of personal writing this is new. I assume there'll be an adjustment period before I'm writing as smoothly as I'd want to be. I wonder if there's a Code extension for rendering `.md` files in the editor? Or am I going to have to switch to WebStorm for that?

I wonder how easy it'll be to configure the site to allow me to post new blog posts without doing a whole deployment. I think I saw other Jekyll themes using some sort of XML feed, so that might be something to investigate.

I might also want to look into setting up two different blog pages; one for writing, and one for more technical entries. Maybe I need to create a to do list...
