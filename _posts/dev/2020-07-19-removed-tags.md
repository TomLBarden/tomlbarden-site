I got rid of the tags filter on the blogs. I'm not happy with the current implementation, and I'm not yet sure how in-depth I want the posts navigation system to be. For now I'll continue to annotate each post with tags in the front-matter, but users won't be able to search by tag. I'll get around to a proper implementation one day, I'm sure, but I need to learn more about Jekyll first, and I don't want to lose the forest for the trees. 

My next post will be something about writing, which is why I made this damn site in the first place.
